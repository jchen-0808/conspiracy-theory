Welcome to conspiracytheories.com (if we paid for the domain). This website allows users to post their favorite conspiracy theories and interact with other people’s posts as well. This website would be a platform for people to post their wildest stories, conspiracy theories or anything that comes to their mind. While conspiracy theories have been controversial in recent years, research shows that people will be less likely to actually believe in a conspiracy theory if they are told that it is not actually fact, which our website does. 

We first require that new users create an account to log in, this saves information on the user for future usage. The site features six main pages. The home page gives everyone an individualized feed. This feed is user-catered conspiracy theories based on their likes and preferences. 

The post page allows the user to post their own conspiracy theory with a title, genre and text. We require that the user provides a title genre and text for better sorting and displays. By pressing the post button, you will be redirected to the recents page with your post now showing!

The recents page shows all the recent posts from all users. Any user can like or dislike the post, affecting the post's overall rating. Posts with more likes are more likely to be suggested to other users. 

The your posts page shows the user’s past posts and the number of likes and dislikes on the posts, ranked from most popular to least popular. Additionally, the page displays the user’s quiz results if they have taken the quiz or encourages the user to take the quiz if they have not.

The quiz is a buzzfeed-style quiz that asks the user to complete 10 questions and find what kind of conspiracy theories they are most likely to believe in. The quiz page shows the possible results from the quiz. Once the user clicks start, they will be redirected to the questions and then the results page. 

Finally, there’s also a change password page that allows users to change their password and a logout button to log the user out.
